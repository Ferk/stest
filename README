stest - filter a file list by properties
====================
stest  takes  a  list  of  files  and filters by the files' properties,
analogous to test(1).  Files which pass all tests are printed to stdout. If no
files  are  given, stest reads files from stdin.

This is meant to be a replacement of the stest tool included with dmenu, for use
with alternative versions of dmenu.

Installation
------------
Enter the following command to build and install stest
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running stest
-------------
See the man page for details.
